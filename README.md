# Extended Setup Instructions
After successfully cloning the repository and installing the necessary dependencies, the next step is to set up the configuration files. The following instructions will guide you in setting up ```gatsby-config.js```, ```tailwind.config.js```, and ```postcss.config.js```.


## Gatsby Configuration - 
Gatsby uses this file to understand the specifics of your site. Here's a basic setup:

Make a new file in the root named - 
```gatsby-config.js```




```javascript
module.exports = {
  siteMetadata: {
    title: `Your Site Title`,
    description: `A brief description of your site`,
    author: `Your Name`,
  },
  plugins: [
    `gatsby-plugin-image`,
    `gatsby-plugin-sass`,
    `gatsby-plugin-sharp`,
    `gatsby-transformer-sharp`,
    `gatsby-plugin-postcss`,
    `gatsby-plugin-emotion`,
    // other plugins you might want to use
  ],
}
```
Replace Your Site Title, A brief description of your site, and Your Name with your own details.

## Tailwind CSS Configuration -
Tailwind CSS uses this file for custom configurations. If this file does not exist, create it at the root of your project. Here is a basic setup:
 
Make a new file in the root named - ```tailwind.config.js```

```javascript
module.exports = {
  purge: ['./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}'],
  darkMode: false,
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {},
  plugins: [],
}
```

## PostCSS Configuration  -
PostCSS uses this file to apply various transformations to your CSS. Here's how you can configure it:
 
Make a new file in the root named - ```postcss.config.js```

```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
    cssnano: {
      preset: 'default',
    },
    // other plugins you might want to use
  },
}

```

## Rendering a Page

Provided you followed directions exactly, and once you have configured the files, you can create a new page.

For example, you might want to create a home page. You can do this by creating a new file at ```src/pages/index.js``` and adding the following content:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Layout } from '../components/layout';

const HomePage = () => {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold">Hello, World!</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my Gatsby site.</p>
    </Layout>
  );
};

export default HomePage;

```
    
## Compile locally
Now, you can start the development server and visit your site:
```bash
npm run develop
```

Then, open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000.

Congratulations, your basic settings are ready, and you can start developing your site!

Please note that these are just basic configurations, and you might need to adjust them according to your specific needs. If you encounter any problems or need further help, please feel free to reach out.
